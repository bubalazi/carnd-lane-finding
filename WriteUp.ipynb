    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most distinctive features of any road is the markings used for guidance of drivers. Naturally, one of the first features to be discerned in a computer vision based self-driving car are **lane-markings**.\n",

    "### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The markings in this project where infered using the following pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Aquire image, convert it to grayscale and equalize-out the image using the opencv built-in histogram equalization routine\n",
    "   \n",
    "![][grayscale]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Apply a Gaussian blur for noise removal and perform a binary threshold\n",
    "   \n",
    "![][blur_thresh]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Extract the Region of interest with hard-coded assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "![][roi]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step4: Convert ROI to edge image and apply a hough transform to identify lines\n",
    "\n",
    "![][edges_lines]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step5:\n",
    "The lines detected through the Hough transform are now iterated through to:\n",
    "* Filter line candidates by a slope threshold (+- 0.44)\n",
    "* Segment left from right lines positive and negative slopes respectively\n",
    "* Filter out noise by extracting all slopes that fall within the median +- one standard deviation\n",
    "* Using the gathered information get good line candidates and make a first degree polynomial fit\n",
    "* Finally, find the crossection of the lines found\n",
